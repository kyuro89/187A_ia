     	<p>We thought the user specific menus such as Prospective Student, Current Student, Family & Visitors, Faculty & Staff are the things that have to be appeared at the very first. The reason is that the whole contents that website might have can be changed for the user specific menu. Thus, we decided to place them at the very middle of the main page. However, we made them not to appear in the secondary pages. That is because users do not need to change once they choose one of the menus.  Thus, we decided to have big four of easy-finding user specific menus at the main page, and then in the secondary pages, we decided to have specific menus by the menu.</p>

  		<td>
  		<p>While building the top navigation menu, we had very hard time with taking things away. From the competitive analysis, we had found seven top menus that we could place on the top navigation. However, when we had 7 menus, the sub-categories were too much overlapped. For example, when we had Services on the top navigation bar, there are so many sub categories that exactly the same as some sub-categories of Student Life such as Housing & Dining, Health & Wellness, Community Services. We decided not to have the Service menu on the top navigation menu.</p>

  		<td>
  		
  		<p>For the main home page, we pretty much focused on making the page as simple as possible, but it has to be easy-to-use, and has the most important information. We looked up many universities websites and found some of them are too simple, and some of them are too messy so not able to guide users to the right place. We as college students, tried to think what we really need when we user our school web site. We asked ourselves what do we click on our school website most often? and we found the answer was that it is the order of user specific, main navigation, and then finally events, calendar and so on. We decided to spend the space of main home page as frequent of being used.</p>
